And every year, more than 3 million have to be treated for injuries sustained at home. More than half the victims of fatal accidents are over 75, falls being the biggest killer.</p><ul><li>About 300 children are killed in the home every year, most of them under five, and some 800,000 receive hospital treatment. Nearly twice as many boys are involved as girls. Fire is the biggest child killer, mostly in house fires but quite often when clothing is set alight by a fire or match flame. Falls cause most child injuries. About one in six are falls down the stairs, and some of the most serious are falls from the windows - particularly high-rise flats.</li><li>For adults under 45, most accidental deaths in the home results from poisoning, mainly from accidental overdoses of medicine but also from alcohol or carbon monoxide poisoning. Women under 64 have fewer fatal accidents than men but suffer a greater number of injuries, generally from cuts, falls (particularly falls down the stairs), bruises, burns and scalds.</li><li>This guide tells you how you can guard against some of the most hazardous home accidents, and takes you on a room-by-room tour of the house and into the garden to point out dangers. It could save your life, or that of someone dear to you.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Good things to note always]]></title><description><![CDATA[Few good things to keep in mind]]></description><link>https://news.n3n.org/good-things-to-note/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5f3a08e91bc89301363e70b1</guid><category><![CDATA[Recommends]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Naman Bishnoi]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 20:43:33 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://news.n3n.org/content/images/2020/04/20804.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://news.n3n.org/content/images/2020/04/20804.jpg" alt="Good things to note always"/><p/><h2 id="another-sample-post">Another Sample Post</h2><p>This is another sample post, just to test if all functionalities are running successfully.</p><p>Please do note that NCRYPTO is still in alpha stage.</p><p>Here are some key points to verify:</p><ul><li>Stay at home</li><li>Stay away from those kids</li><li>Don't do drugs, ever!</li></ul><p>If all the aforementioned points are being successfully followed by you then congrats!</p><p>Here are some sweet candies for you.

Most of the "brethren" think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.</p><p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.</p><p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p><p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p><p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p><p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p><p>If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, "brethren!" Be careful, teachers!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Network Security Operations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Network security‚Äôs primary operational objective is to prevent, detect, and
