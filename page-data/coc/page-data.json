No employee should suffer any disadvantage as a result of complying\nwith the NCRYPTO Code of Ethics.\n\nIn detail:\n\nNCRYPTO Labs Good Conscience Principles\n 1.  We operate lawfully\n 2.  We avoid conflicts of interest\n 3.  We do not tolerate corruption\n 4.  We play fair\n 5.  We handle information carefully\n 6.  We follow export control and customs laws\n 7.  We observe occupational health and safety standards\n 8.  We manage assets carefully\n 9.  We do not support money laundering\n 10. We do not tolerate discrimination\n\nWe operate lawfully\nNCRYPTO abides the law\nAll applicable legislation must be observed in all business decisions and\noperations both at home and abroad. Sustainable business for everyone’s benefit\ncan only be achieved with fair competition and strict confor­mity with the law.\nCorruption, cartels, embezzlement and fraud distort com­petition and increase\ncosts, which may cause significant fines, reputa­tion damage and, ultimately,\ncould also endanger the employment at NCRYPTO.\n\nIn view of this, we refuse to conduct unfair and/or dishonest business\nprac­tices and carry out our business in a manner that is free of bribery and\ncorruption.\n\nIt should be noted that breaches of the law will not be tolerated and may result\nin disciplinary action.\n\nWe avoid conflicts of interest\nNCRYPTO avoids conflicts of interest\nIndependence, integrity and transpar­ency of our services are the founda­tion of\nour customers’ trust in us.\n\nHowever, a conflict of interest can severely damage that trust. A conflict of\ninterest can arise when the private interests of a NCRYPTO employee could or do\nconflict with the interests of NCRYPTO. For instance, if a NCRYPTO employee has\na shareholding in a supplier, customer or competitor of NCRYPTO, or an\nemployment of any kind with a third party this may lead to a conflict of\ninterest.\n\nWe do not tolerate corruption\nNCRYPTO does not tolerate corruption\nCorruption distorts competition with the business world and causes damage to\nboth individuals and society. Corruption can also result in actions being made\nunder criminal and civil law for NCRYPTO employees as well as for NCRYPTO. This\ncould include anything from a prison sentence to fines. Corruption is strictly\nprohibited in all countries in which NCRYPTO operates, and any violations of\nsuch are therefore not in the “beneficial interest of the company.” This\ncontin­ues to apply to all employees, regard­less of their nationality.\n\nWe play fair\nNCRYPTO believes in fair game\nFair and free competition between companies is the guarantor for free­dom of\nbusiness behavior and effec­tive consumer protection. Fair and free competition\nis protected by anti­ trust laws, which forbid cartels and abuse by\nmarket­-dominating compa­nies. Mergers of companies are also subject to merger\ncontrols under certain conditions.\n\nA cartel exists when several compa­nies coordinate their behavior on the market\nto restrict or eliminate compe­tition. For instance, if there are agree­ments in\nplace between competitors about prices, quantities, territories or customer\ngroups.\n\nA position of market domination is abused when the possibilities for economic\nbehavior of other com­panies – competitors, customers or suppliers – are\nsignificantly affected, without objective justification, by the behavior of the\nmarket­dominating company.\n\nWe handle information carefully\nNCRYPTO is committed to correct and truthful reporting\nThe exchange of information and the use of our know­how are part of our daily\ncommercial activity. It is import­ant to handle information correctly and\ntransparently in order to protect it, our company and our customers.\n\nRecords and financial integrity\n\nInternal and external transparency, as well as correct and truthful report­ing,\nis the standard of our entrepre­neurial action and behavior.\n\nNCRYPTO protects its own and third party’s trade secrets and other confidential\ninformation\nConfidentiality\n\nAs a provider of technical services, NCRYPTO possesses valuable know­ how as\nwell as comprehensive trade secrets, which are the basis for the successful\nbusiness operations of NCRYPTO. The unauthorized disclosure or otherwise making\nthis knowledge accessible can lead to severe losses for NCRYPTO, and result in\nsanctions under criminal or civil law. Therefore it is inadmissible. In order to\nsecure our own and third­party information from unauthorized disclosures, we\nmust adopt special precautionary measures when handling confidential\ninformation.\n\nNCRYPTO provides for information security\nInformation security\n\nInformation technology and data pro­ cessing play a key role for task\nful­fillment at NCRYPTO. All important strategic and operational functions and\ntasks are significantly supported by information technology. But infor­mation\ntechnology and data process­ing also present risks concerning the security of\nthe data.\n\nNCRYPTO collects, processes, and uses personal data in compliance with the\napplicable data privacy laws\nData privacy\n\nElectronic information exchanged via Internet, Intranet, e­mail, etc., is part\nof our daily business. This electronic information exchange can also include\npersonal data such as name, address or date of birth. The handling of per­ sonal\ndata is regulated in many coun­ tries by data privacy laws in order to protect\nthe individual’s privacy and right to determine what and when personal\ninformation is disclosed. In general, it is necessary to obtain the consent of\nthe person affected for the collection, processing or use of their data. If the\ndata is intended to be transferred abroad, further require­ ments must be\nobserved (e.g. ensuring an appropriate data privacy level by using model\ncontracts).\n\nWe follow export control and customs laws\nNCRYPTO follows the export control and customs regulations in all countries in\nwhich we do business\nAs a worldwide operating enterprise, NCRYPTO is subject to various national and\ninternational foreign trade regula­tions. These treaties and laws regu­late the\nimport, export and/or transfer (which can also take place electronic­ally) of\ngoods, technologies, services, capital and currency over particu­lar\ninternational borders right up to the complete banning of trade with particular\ncountries (embargo). Any trading restrictions and bans can arise from the\ncharacter or purpose of use of the goods or services, the country of origin or\ncountry of use, or the business partner. The export of goods with both civilian\nand military uses (so­called dual use goods) also requires approval. Export\ncontrols cover exchanges between NCRYPTO subsidiaries too.\n\nWe observe occupational health and safety standards\nNCRYPTO observes occupational health and safety standards\nThe protection of our employees is of primary importance for NCRYPTO, since our\nemployees are essential for us as a provider of technical services.\n\nWe manage assets carefully\nNCRYPTO manages its own and third-party assets carefully\nTangible and intangible assets of NCRYPTO (e.g. cash, machinery, know­how,\npatents and trademarks) constitute NCRYPTO’s business assets, which may only be\nused for business purposes. The same applies for the property of NCRYPTO\nbusi­ness partners, with whom NCRYPTO employees come into contact in the course\nof their work.\n\nWe do not support money laundering\nNCRYPTO does not support money laundering\nMoney laundering occurs when ille­gally acquired financial means (from criminal\nactivities like organized crime, bribery, corruption or terrorism) are smuggled\ninto the legal, financial and economic circulation in order to disguise their\nreal origin or the identity of the owner.\n\nNCRYPTO only maintains business relationships with respectable busi­ness\npartners, whose business activ­ities comply with all applicable laws and whose\nfunds derive from law­ful activities. For this purpose, we at NCRYPTO observe\nmoney laundering regulations at home and abroad, and keep our distance from\nbusinesses that are used for money laundering.\n\nWe do not tolerate discrimination\nNCRYPTO does not tolerate discrimination\nNCRYPTO is a worldwide operat­ing company that is active in various countries,\nall with different cultures. At NCRYPTO, our attitude is that peo­ple of\ndifferent ethnic origin, religion, world view, race, age, disability, gen­der or\nsexual identity are invaluable for our success.\n\nNo employee or business partner may be directly or indirectly discriminated\nagainst, sexually harassed or person­ally disparaged on the basis of any of\nthese attributes, and will be protected by applicable equality legislation.","html":"<h2 id=\"scope-of-applicability\">Scope of Applicability</h2><p>The NCRYPTO Code of Ethics is binding for all NCRYPTO employees worldwide.</p><p>All NCRYPTO employees shall receive the NCRYPTO Code of Ethics as an electronic copy (via e-mail as a PDF file) or as a printed version in a language that they are familiar with.
