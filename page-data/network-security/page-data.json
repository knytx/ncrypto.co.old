Network security examines data traversing the enterprise\nnetwork to detect intrusions against the network and the computers connected to\nit. In addition, the network architecture and its defenses can be used to\nchannel user and attacker activity, routing it toward sensors and defensive\nmechanisms and away from weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n\nNetwork security needs to be considered in terms of security controls that\ninclude the following:\n\n * Preventive controls such as firewalls that block attacker activity and\n   separate sections of the network from each other.\n * Detective controls, such as Intrusion Detection, that detect attacker\n   activity that cannot be blocked.\n\nMonitoring controls that capture activity that is input to correlation engines\nthat support forensics, investigations, and more sophisticated attack detection\nthat considers multiple variables and data sources.\n\nContainment is another important capability that network security can provide.\nContainment involves isolating attacker activity in one part of the enterprise\n(for example, end-user workstations or Internet-facing web servers) from other\nIT functions such as financial systems in order to provide for a layered\ndefense. Similarly, network security can be used to establish compartments in\nthe enterprise that can be used to contain attacks and give defenders\nopportunities to catch them before they proceed too far.\n\nNetwork security can also involve filtering and monitoring the network\nenterprise traffic to block malicious network traffic and to detect attacker\nnetwork traffic when attacks occur. It used to be that network security was\nsatisfied by simply having a network firewall; today network security includes a\nlong list of services, devices, proxies, and other capabilities that are rapidly\nchanging and evolving.\n\nNetwork Security: Goal and Objectives\nVerizon found that 92% of breaches involved activities perpetrated by outsiders\nentering an enterprise from the Internet.1 Mandiant has observed that\nsophisticated attackers can work around multiple layers of network defenses,\nparticularly when computers and servers in the enterprise have Internet access.2\nThese two factors combine to make network security a central and critical\ncomponent of successful enterprise IT defense. Network security is also a\npowerful defensive capability, particularly when it is integrated with other\nsecurity functional areas creating an integrated defense.\n\nNetwork security’s goal is to protect the enterprise’s network from use or\nattack by an adversary. Network security major objectives include the following:\n\n * The preventive objective is to block malicious traffic from passing from one\n   part of the network to another, or channeling that traffic so that it can be\n   detected through other means.\n * The detective objective is to monitor and analyze network traffic in order to\n   detect malicious traffic while it is in transit.\n * The forensic objective is to log information about network traffic, or\n   possibly all of the network traffic itself, so that the network traffic can\n   be analyzed by detective controls, or to support investigations and audits.\n\nThe audit objective involves analyzing network traffic in order to identify\nmalicious activity or to generate artifacts indicating the lack of malicious\nactivity. This activity may be determined by a number of characteristics,\nincluding the source and destination addresses, protocols used, timing, or data\ncontained within the traffic.\n\nNetwork Security: Threat Vectors\nMost targeted attacks utilize the network in some way and rely on the network to\nperpetuate their attack while it is in-progress. Network security threat vectors\ninclude the following:\n\n * Attackers enter the enterprise through outbound network connections from\n   servers or clients on the internal network.\n * Attackers enter the enterprise through the network connections of\n   Internet-facing servers.\n * Attackers use internal networks to move laterally between computers inside\n   the enterprise.\n * Attackers use enterprise networks to extract data and remove it from the\n   enterprise.\n\nAttackers take control of network infrastructure components and then leverage\nthem to gain entry to the enterprise or to bypass other security measures.\n\nNetwork Security: Capabilities\nNetwork security includes a large number of capabilities that should be\nconsidered for deployment as part of an integrated security solution. Network\nsecurity capabilities provide preventive, detective, forensic, and audit\nfunctions on the enterprise network. Network security technology or capability\nis not a “silver bullet” that will satisfy all cybersecurity requirements.\nHowever, an integrated set of capabilities can block, detect, and intercept many\npotential attacks.\n\nFollowing are some network security capabilities. Appendix C provides detailed\ndescriptions for these capabilities.\n\n * Switches and routers\n * Software Defined Networking (SDN)\n * Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n * Network Time Protocol (NTP)\n * Network service management\n * Firewall and virtual machine firewall\n * Network Intrusion Detection/Network Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS)\n * Wireless networking (Wi-Fi)\n * Packet intercept and capture\n * Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) intercept\n * Network Access Control (NAC)\n * Virtual Private Networking (VPN) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)\n * Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)\n * Network Data Analytics (NDA)\n\nNS\nNetwork security makes a network safe from cyberattacks. More specifically, this\nfunctional area provides for the security of enterprise networks, their\nservices, and access to them from the Internet and internally connected devices.\nNetwork security needs to be considered in terms of preventive, detective, and\nmonitoring controls.\n\nNS-01: Switches and Routers\nSwitches and routers are the building blocks of an information technology\nnetwork. Protection of these critical infrastructure components (logical and\nphysical) is one the important capabilities of a security framework.\n\nNS-02: Software Defined Networking (SDN)\nSoftware Defined Networking provides a greater flexibility in deployment and\nmanagement of the networking devices (routers, switches, and so on). Along with\nthese operational benefits, it provides better control over data flows, helping\nadministrators thwart various denial of service attacks.\n\nNS-03: Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\nThe domain name system translates hostnames to IP addresses so names can be used\nwhen referring to unique addresses on the Internet. Protection mechanisms to\nprotect against internal and Internet DNS attacks (for example, DNS poisoning)\nare required in a network.\n\nNS-04: Network Time Protocol (NTP)\nTo record timestamps in security audit logs and systems logs, all information\nsystems must synchronize their clocks to a master clock. This synchronization\nhelps to ensure accuracy of the audit logs and aid in event correlation. Network\ntime protocol can be utilized for this purpose.\n\nNS-05: Network Service Management\nNetwork management infrastructure frequently uses secure shell (SSH) and simple\nnetwork management protocol (SNMP) to manage networking components at the\nenterprise level. These components must be hardened to protect them from attack\nand abuse.\n\nNS-06: Firewall and Virtual Machine Firewall\nFirewalls are utilized to restrict access from one network to another and\nenforce enterprise specific policies of acceptable actions on the network. A\ncommon firewall application is to separate an enterprise’s internal network from\nthe Internet. There are various types of firewalls (for example, packet\nfiltering, stateful firewalls, and application proxy firewalls). As more and\nmore information systems are virtualized, host-based or VM-based firewalls are\nused to isolate various VMs running on the same host.\n\nNS-07: Network Intrusion Detection / Network Intrusion Prevention System (IDS /\nIPS)\nNetwork intrusion detection systems (IDS) continuously scan the network and\nincoming data traffic for malicious activities. IDS logs malicious events in a\nsecurity log to investigate a malicious session after the fact. Network\nintrusion prevention (IPS) enforces predefined network policies to prevent\nmalicious events from taking place. Some of the commercially available products\ncombine IDS and IPS into a single system referred to as intrusion detection and\nprevention system (IDPS).\n\nNS-08: Wireless Networking (Wi-Fi)\nWireless technology enables devices to connect to a private network or the\nInternet without needing physical cables. Because wireless communications can be\nlistened to by anyone within range, wireless networks are vulnerable to\nsnooping, monitoring, and unauthorized connection. This capability involves\nsecuring wireless networking against potential attack.\n\nNS-09: Packet Intercept and Capture\nNetwork packet intercept and capture is a process of capturing and examining\ntraffic on a network segment. This process examines protocols and their content\nfor appropriateness. The captured information is logged for further analysis by\nusers or tools. There is a wide variety of packet interceptors available in the\nmarket. Network engineers can use network protocol analyzers to understand\nnetwork performance or read information contained in the data packets.\n\nNS-10: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Intercept\nWith the advent of sophisticated cyberattacks, new products were developed to\nfill the gap identified in detection of outgoing encrypted traffic. It was long\nassumed that encrypted traffic originating within the boundaries of an\nenterprise must be necessary and not warrant further examination. Attackers have\ntaken advantage of this false sense of security. There have been many security\nincidents where critical data was transmitted to the hacker’s machines via an\nencrypted channel using a rogue digital certificate. SSL interceptors fill this\nsecurity gap by examining encrypted connections for malicious traffic. To work,\nthe interceptor needs the current digital certificate from the host to decrypt\nthe traffic.\n\nNS-11: Network Access Control (NAC)\nNetwork access control is a technology that verifies security posture (for\nexample, patching level, malicious software, anti-virus, encryption strength,\nand so forth) before it grants network access permission. This technology is\ncommonly used in an enterprise’s internal network to keep unauthorized computers\nfrom connecting to the enterprise’s network. In some cases, NAC is used as part\nof a remote access solution, such as virtual private network.\n\nNS-12: Virtual Private Networking (VPN) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)\nVPN is a technology that provides the ability to extend an enterprise’s internal\nnetworking resources\nto external or remote users in a secure manner. There are two commonly used\nprotocols to deploy this technology: secure sockets layer (SSL) and IPSec. Both\nprotocols may be combined with two-factor authentication (for example, smart\ncard or public key infrastructure [PKI] token) for authentication and encryption\nof the communication channel.\n\nNS-13: Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)\nNetwork Traffic Analysis is the examination of the volume of traffic generated.\nThere is no need for in-depth packet inspection. The goal is to monitor the\nnetwork to determine if there a significant event happening or going to happen\nbased on the network traffic patterns.\n\nNS-14: Network Data Analytics (NDA)\nNetwork Data Analytics analyze network traffic trends, network availability,\nplanned outage impacts, and network traffic. NDA is utilized in combination with\nother analysis tools to create a comprehensive model of various network threats.\nNDA’s goal is, in part, to predict the next big network-based attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n1Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, 2013. 2Mandiant M-Trends Annual\nReport, 2013.","html":"<p>Network security’s purpose is to protect the enterprise network from unauthorized access.
